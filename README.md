# Cartoon Talks Chatbot

## Description
This is a simple rule-based chatbot that answers questions about various cartoon characters. The chatbot is built entirely using custom logic without any pre-trained libraries or APIs.

## How to Run the Chatbot
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Save the chatbot code into a file named chatbot.py.
3. Run the script: python chatbot.py.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- tkinter (built into Python)

## Explanation of the Code
1. *Logic*: The chatbot uses a dictionary to map user queries to predefined responses.
2. *GUI*: A tkinter-based GUI allows users to interact with the chatbot in a chat-like interface.
3. *Input Handling*: The chatbot processes user input, searches for a match in its rules, and provides an appropriate response.

## Possible Future Developments
1. *Expand Rules*: Add more cartoon characters and questions.
2. *Natural Language Parsing*: Enhance input matching with fuzzy matching or tokenization.
3. *Advanced UI*: Develop a React.js-based frontend for a more attractive and responsive UI.
4. *Database Integration*: Store questions and answers in a database for easier management.
